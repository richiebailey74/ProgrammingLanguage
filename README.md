# ProgrammingLanguage
This project creates a new programming language based off of the Java compiler. It uses Gradle in IntelliJ. It is broken into 5 components (with helper classes) that is designed to take in a typed out program in our langauge and then output code functionality. The project is broken down into a Lexer, Parser, Interpreter, Analyzer, and Generator.
